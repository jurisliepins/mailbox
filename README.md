# Mailbox

Mailbox is a simple actor library for Java 21+. The goal of this library is to simplify writing asynchronous, IO bound code.
This is a thin abstraction on top of Virtual Threads that can be introduced to any codebase without the need to commit your whole project to an actor framework.

The goal is **not** to make this ðŸš€ _Blazingly Fastâ„¢_ ðŸš€. There are other libraries and frameworks that achieve that better than this one. 
The performance of this library is tied directly to what Java Virtual Threads are capable of.  

The design is inspired by the [MailboxProcessor](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/MailboxProcessor) from F# and is implemented using [Virtual Threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/444).
