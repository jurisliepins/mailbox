# Mailbox

Mailbox is a simple actor library for Java 21+. The goal of this library is to make writing asynchronous, IO bound code as simple as possible.
The goal is **not** to make this ðŸš€ _Blazingly Fastâ„¢_ ðŸš€. There are other libraries and frameworks that achieve that at the expense of simplicity. 
The performance of this library is tied directly to what Java Virtual Threads are capable of.  

The design is inspired by the [MailboxProcessor](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/MailboxProcessor) from F# and is implemented using [Virtual Threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/444).
